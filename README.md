                 Regex Data Extraction

This project demonstrates how to use Regular Expressions (Regex) in Python to extract structured data from unstructured text.

                 Features

The script can extract:

1. Email addresses (e.g., user@example.com)

2. URLs (e.g., https://www.example.com)

3. Phone numbers (various formats like (123) 456-7890, 123-456-7890, 079.176.1041

4. Currency amounts (e.g., $19.99, $1,234.56)

                How It Works

1. A text input (string) is passed into the program.

2. Each type of data is matched using a regular expression pattern.

3. The matches are returned as a list of extracted values.
